I recently had the opportunity to attend the **Q&A Session with Steve Conine ’95**, where Steve, co-founder and co-chairman of Wayfair, shared his journey in the retail industry. His insights touched on customer focus, leadership, efficient time management, and the role of technology.  

## Key Takeaways  

### Career Journey and Early Experience  
- Steve’s career started with consulting in the 1990s, building websites and working on an internet directory service.  
- His family farm background helped him develop practical problem-solving skills early on.  
- As a founder, he emphasized the importance of creating a **capital structure that motivates the founder** and understanding whether people will actually buy your product.  

### Product Development and Customer Focus  
- He highlighted the importance of **avoiding over-polishing** when developing a minimum viable product (MVP) and focusing on customer feedback instead of guessing features.  
- A failed $20 return protection program served as a reminder that not all experiments work.  
- His central question: **“Are you doing the right thing for your customers?”**  

### Leadership and Team Management  
- Leadership in small teams requires rigor—**remove people who are not a good fit** early to maintain alignment and productivity.  
- Motivating leaders involves inspiring them to guide and grow their teams effectively.  
- He stressed that **90% of learning happens on the job**, while only 10% comes from books, and that success is non-linear—**don’t fear the unknown.**  

### Technology and AI Insights  
- On AI, he noted, **“We are figuring it out together; it’s new, but it’s the right field.”**  
- He encouraged embracing curiosity and uncertainty when working with emerging technologies.  

### Time Management and Public Speaking  
- Time management is crucial—**block off time to prioritize learning and important activities.**  
- Strong communication and public speaking skills are essential for professional growth.  

### Life and Purpose  
- While not elaborated deeply, Steve highlighted the importance of reflecting on the **purpose of life**.  

Hearing Steve’s candid reflections and practical advice was inspiring and reinforced key principles of entrepreneurship: customer focus, leadership, and adaptability. It was a privilege to gain insights from someone who has navigated such a successful journey in business.
